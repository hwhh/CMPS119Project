     <h4>Rosana Francescato</h4>
     <p><img src="{% static 'images/Rosana_Francescato.jpg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="194" width="271">Rosana writes for <a href="https://pvsolarreport.com/author/rfrancescato">PV Solar Report</a> .  She learned of SunWork through RE-volv, SunWork’s funding partner for several nonprofit installations. Since then she has helped publicize SunWork through blog articles and several local neighborhood groups.</p>
     <p>Based on her energy usage, and additional solar for a possible electric car or heat pump, SunWork installed a 3.36 kilowatt (kW) system consisting of twelve 280-watt panels. Rosana wanted shade resistance and per-panel monitoring, so SunWork installed Enphase microinverters and monitoring. She recently received her PG&E “True-Up” bill, which each solar customer receives once per year for any charges for energy drawn from the grid. Her total bill for the year after the monthly PG&E minimum usage fee: 5 cents!</p>
     <p>Rosana is helping expand the clean energy community. She <a href="https://localcleanenergy.dm.networkforgood.com/emails/build-clean-power-solutions-with-us-49238aac-ec46-4389-8282-54d9db4b5975">teaches solar classes</a>. </p>
     <p>She was previously a member of the Steering Committee for the Local Clean Energy Alliance, the Bay Area’s largest clean energy coalition, which helped bring Community Choice Energy to Alameda County (for much more information, see Community Choice Energy a Plus for the Environment & for Solar Customers in this issue).</p>
     <p>This June, Rosana joined a working group consisting of PG&E employees, several Community Choice Energy partners, and solar installation companies. The group’s focus includes improved collaboration on communication regarding solar and Community Choice Energy issues, including the complex monthly PG&E bill.</p>
     <p>Rosana, thanks for being part of the solar community.</p>

     <h4>Marshall Gingold</h4>
     <p><img src="{% static 'images/Marshall_Gingold_photo.jpeg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="246" width="178">As far back as 2010, Marshall Gingold had been considering solar as an option for his Sunnyvale home, but was deterred by the high costs and long payback periods he was quoted by solar installers.   He had invested in various efficiency measures for his home and used less than $100 of electricity per month, making the economics of solar more challenging.</p>
     <p>In 2014, however, Marshall learned about SunWork through a neighbor and received a quote for a system with a payback of less than seven years.  This convinced him to move ahead with the installation of a 14-panel, 3.5 kW system.  Since the fall of 2014, the system has been saving Marshall more than $1,000 per year and he notes that “to date, we have generated over 13,000 kWh and avoided over 10 tons of CO2 in the process.”</p>
     <p>Marshall has been so enthusiastic about solar energy that he has volunteered with both SunWork and Sunnyvale’s city-wide “Energize Sunnyvale” campaign, using his marketing talents to help spread the word about the potential for solar. </p>
     <p>Marshall chose a rooftop system with a central inverter that has a “Secure Power Supply” feature.  This lets him avoid the typical problem of not being able to generate usable power when the utility grid isn’t operating.  He notes that “as long as the sun is shining, I can power up to 1,500 W of devices from my PV system even if the PG&E grid is entirely down.  This would come in handy during a long outage after an earthquake, so I can power cell phones, computers, heaters, and other appliances.” </p>
     <p>Since he has an electric vehicle, Marshall takes advantage of PG&E's EV Rate for his electricity, which is a great deal for those with solar.  It allows him to be paid $.44 for the kWhs he puts onto the PG&E grid during summertime peak periods and pay only $.11 for the kWhs that he uses at night to charge his vehicle.</p>

     <h4>SunWork Partners to Help Oakland’s Harbor House and Others Go Solar</h4>
     <p><img src="{% static 'images/Harbor_House_installation_celebration_2017.jpg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="227" width="258"><img src="{% static 'images/Harbor_House_14_kW_System.jpg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="227" width="302"></p>
     <p>SunWork has partnered with nonprofit RE-volv for several nonprofit solar installations around the Bay Area including the Harbor House installation in the summer of 2017.</p>
     <p>SunWork designed the system, and with the help of many volunteers, built the 14.4 kW solar system with 48 solar panels that will reduce Harbor House’s electric bills by roughly 39%, saving around $111,000 over 25 years. The money saved will help improve the quality of Harbor House services and enable them to serve more of the community.</p>
     <p>Helping Harbor House save money and preventing CO2 emissions are great goals by themselves, however this project is about much more. It's about locally driven change that empowers people to take control of their communities’ health. It's about educating children about solar, and making sure that the next generation knows the value of clean renewable energy and protecting the environment. It’s about making the value of solar accessible to all communities. It’s about getting everyone involved and giving everyone a chance to make a difference. Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/YKqF10gUbE4">video</a> on Harbor House and RE-volv’s successful crowdfunding campaign.  </p>
     <p><u>You can help First Baptist Church in Oakland go solar</u> in 2018 by supporting RE-volv's crowdfunding campaign here.  SunWork designed the system and along with our volunteers, we  will complete the installation if the campaign is successful.</p>

     <h4>Wildlife Sanctuary Harnesses Solar to Power Mission</h4>
     <p><img src="{% static 'images/WildLife_Associates_3.jpg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="227" width="302"></p>
     <p><a href="http://www.wildlifeassociates.org/">Wildlife Associates</a> provides nationally acclaimed educational programs throughout the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. At their 120-acre wildlife sanctuary in Half Moon Bay, they care for more than 50 non-releasable animals that could not survive in the wild.  </p>
     <p>In 2016, SunWork and our volunteers installed 90 solar panels, creating a 27 kW system to power Wildlife Associates operations.  SunWork partnered with <a href="http://www.everybodysolar.org/">Everybody Solar</a> who identified the opportunity, raised funds for the project and worked with several companies for donations.  <a href="http://www.jinkosolar.com/">Jinko Solar</a> provided the solar panels, <a href="https://enphase.com/en-us">Enphase</a> donated the inverters, and <a href="http://www.mounting-systems.us/">Mounting Systems</a> provided the mounting hardward.</p>
     <p>Wildlife Associates now saves over $8,000 a year with the system allowing them to put more resources toward helping wildlife and educating kids.  Check out the video of Bruce Holaday, Wildlife Associates, Executive Director.</p>

     <h4>All Saints Church - San Leandro</h4>
     <h5>Solar is Cornerstone of Church Greening Project</h5>
     <img src="{% static 'images/All Saints Church - Justin Cannon - compressed.jpg' %}" style="float: left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="296" width="222">
     <img src="{% static 'images/Installing at All Saint Church - San Leandro.jpg' %}" style="float: right; margin-left: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px;" alt="" height="227" width="263">
     <p>As part of a comprehensive greening project, All Saints Episcopal Church in San Leandro worked with SunWork to install a 9.24kw solar power system on their church in November 2016. The system includes 33 panels and will generate enough electricity to cover the church’s entire electricity bill. The greening project at the church has also brought heightened awareness around recycling and other energy-efficiency improvements to the congregation.</p>
     <p>The Rev. Justin R. Cannon (left), rector of All Saints Church, is a strong advocate for environmental causes. He is the founder and director of <a href="http://holyhikes.org/">Holy Hikes</a>
         , leads a noontime “Celtic Earth Mass” every Wednesday at the church, and believes that “we cannot honor the Creator if we do not care for God’s creation.” </p>
