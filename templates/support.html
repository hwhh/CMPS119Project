            SunWork's operations are structured to be self-sufficient monetarily. This is essential to keeping it from competing for resources with other organizations with complementary missions, and to allowing its model to be easily expanded or recreated elsewhere. </p>
     <p> SunWork's operational costs are covered by charges applied to its solar electricity system installations. The main "outside" support it rests on are the resources donated by its volunteers – their time, enthusiasm, and effort – although properly speaking the volunteers are every bit as internal to the SunWork team as its directors or staff.</p>
     <p>SunWork's office and warehouse are located the Sobrato Center for Nonprofits in Milpitas. &nbsp;And we thank the Sobrato Foundation for supporting our mission in this way. </p>
